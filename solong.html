        <!-- <p>
            After I recited to her a poem I’d just written, she got up and walked slowly towards the balcony. Leaning against the railing, she said in a gleeful tone – That was beautiful. As I began scribbling again, the room was suddenly filled with a burst of melancholy, when in a hesitant whisper she uttered – Why do you not capture me in one of your poems?
        </p>
        <p>
            I looked up. There she stood gazing away at the land afar with her hair swaying quite a bit in the evening wind. She had never looked more beautiful. Walking towards her in a slow stride, I said gently – Because I can’t. I can’t capture you in a few lines, or a few pages or a few books. You are a cloud that eludes me at every turn. But if I could, I would...

            My eyes have called so long
            <br>So long for another sight
            <br>So long for the golden days
            <br>So long for the mystical night
            <br>So long have these words flown
            <br>So long has the fire blown
            <br>So long have I hurled myself
            <br>Hurled myself with the gloomy fist
            <br>and yet I find me standing here
            <br>Trying to look beyond the mist.

            These thoughts have wandered so long
            <br>So long in the african sands
            <br>So long in the doors of hell
            <br>So long in the heavenly lands
            <br>So long have I seeked the views
            <br>So long have I felt the news
            <br>So long have I woken myself
            <br>Awake form a deadly dream
            <br>and yet I find myself dreaming again
            <br>Seeking the view beyond the beam

            Darkened have the days so long
            <br>So long has the sun been dim
            <br>So long has the horizon hid
            <br>So long have I been this grim
            <br>So long have I called the rays
            <br>So long have I sat and gazed
            <br>So long have I peeked the mind
            <br>And looked the truth in the eyes
            <br>And yet I find myself believing again
            <br>Loving all these excellent lies
