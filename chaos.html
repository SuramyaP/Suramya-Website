        <!-- <p>
            After I recited to her a poem I’d just written, she got up and walked slowly towards the balcony. Leaning against the railing, she said in a gleeful tone – That was beautiful. As I began scribbling again, the room was suddenly filled with a burst of melancholy, when in a hesitant whisper she uttered – Why do you not capture me in one of your poems?
        </p>
        <p>
            I looked up. There she stood gazing away at the land afar with her hair swaying quite a bit in the evening wind. She had never looked more beautiful. Walking towards her in a slow stride, I said gently – Because I can’t. I can’t capture you in a few lines, or a few pages or a few books. You are a cloud that eludes me at every turn. But if I could, I would...

            Dark is what the days have been, cold and all the same.
            <br>Engulfed are the forests seen, burning through a flame.
            <br>The skies glow very less, the night is heavy and long.
            <br>Sad is time and sad is face, sad is every song.

        </p>

        <p class="center-text">
            Fear strikes every man and every living thing there is.
            <br>Hope leaves when it can and yet stays to tease.
            <br>Victory is already hard to see and yet it hides from eyes
            <br>But win has never been the key to open up the skies.

        <p class="center-text">
            Tough are times and tough are days and blinding is the night.
            <br>Rough are crimes the more I gaze and quivering is the sight.
            <br>Heavy is head and loaded is mind and life feels hard to hold.
            <br>Hope is dead and death is kind and everything feels too cold.

        </p>
        <p class="center-text">
            Cries heard all around and agony Is the feel.
            <br>And life breaks without a sound yet hope is hard to kill.
            <br>"Rise again" shouts the mind,"Rise again and fight,"
            <br>"Leave all your pain behind and live another night." 

        </p>
        <p class="center-text">
            Falling is the soul of thine, void it shall create.
            <br>Leaving is the love of mine, oh this wrenching fate.
            <br>Pain is felt in every bone, yet pain is easy to bear.
            <br>Loss keeps the heart alone, oh loss and its despair.
